# vineyard

Here I intend to implement a small lisp with blocking concurrency semantics and
threads that compiles to Javascript.

It's named after Adriaan van Wijngaarden who first discovered continuations.
His surname translates from Dutch to English as vineyard.

> Apparently, the earliest description of a use of continuations was given
> by Adriaan van Wijngaarden (Director of the Mathematisch Centrum in
> Amsterdam) in September 1964, at an IFIP Working Conference on Formal
> Language Description Languages held in Baden bei Wien, Austria. 
> 
> From The Discoveries of Continuations by John C. Reynolds.
